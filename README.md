# Ocean

Ocean is a mobile-enabled Hexo theme based on the features in Hexo's default theme landscape. Since I am a Designer and not a Coder, the Ocean code may not be perfect! I am very grateful to [youchen1992](https://github.com/youchen1992) for providing technical support during the Ocean production process.
